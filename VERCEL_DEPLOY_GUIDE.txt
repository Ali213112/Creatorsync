STEP-BY-STEP: DEPLOY TO VERCEL
===========================================

✅ Your code is already on GitHub: https://github.com/Ali213112/Creatorsync
✅ Now let's deploy it to Vercel!

===========================================
STEP 1: Sign Up / Log In to Vercel
===========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up" (top right)
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
5. You'll be redirected to Vercel dashboard

===========================================
STEP 2: Import Your Project
===========================================

1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Add New Project" button
2. You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
3. Find "Creatorsync" in the list
4. Click "Import" next to Creatorsync

===========================================
STEP 3: Configure Project Settings
===========================================

You'll see a configuration page. Here's what to set:

PROJECT NAME:
- Keep default: "creatorsync" (or change if you want)

FRAMEWORK PRESET:
- Should auto-detect: "Next.js"
- If not, select "Next.js"

ROOT DIRECTORY:
- Leave as "." (default - means root folder)

BUILD COMMAND:
- Should be: "npm run build" (auto-filled)
- If empty, type: npm run build

OUTPUT DIRECTORY:
- Leave empty (Next.js handles this automatically)

INSTALL COMMAND:
- Should be: "npm install" (auto-filled)
- If empty, type: npm install

===========================================
STEP 4: Add Environment Variables
===========================================

IMPORTANT: Do this BEFORE clicking Deploy!

1. Click "Environment Variables" section (below project settings)
2. Click "Add" or the "+" button
3. Add these variables one by one:

   VARIABLE 1:
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_STORY_PROTOCOL_NETWORK
   Value: aeneid
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   Click "Save"

   VARIABLE 2 (Choose ONE - OpenAI OR Hugging Face):
   
   Option A - If you have OpenAI key:
   Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
   Value: (paste your OpenAI API key)
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   Click "Save"
   
   Option B - If you have Hugging Face key:
   Name: HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
   Value: (paste your Hugging Face API key)
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   Click "Save"

   VARIABLE 3 (Optional - Story Protocol API key):
   Name: STORY_PROTOCOL_API_KEY
   Value: (your Story Protocol API key - if you have one)
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
   Click "Save"

4. After adding all variables, you should see them listed

===========================================
STEP 5: Deploy!
===========================================

1. Scroll down and click the big blue "Deploy" button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes while Vercel:
   - Installs dependencies (npm install)
   - Builds your app (npm run build)
   - Deploys to production
3. You'll see a progress bar and logs
4. When it says "Ready" - you're done! 🎉

===========================================
STEP 6: Get Your Live URL
===========================================

After deployment completes:

1. You'll see "Congratulations! Your project has been deployed"
2. Click the URL shown (like: https://creatorsync-xxxxx.vercel.app)
3. Your app is LIVE! 🚀
4. Share this URL with anyone!

===========================================
STEP 7: Test Your App
===========================================

1. Open your live URL
2. Test the homepage
3. Try connecting wallet (MetaMask)
4. Test creator portal
5. Everything should work!

===========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
===========================================

If deployment fails:

1. Check the build logs (shown during deployment)
2. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables → Add them in Settings
   - Build errors → Check logs for specific errors
   - TypeScript errors → Fix in code and push to GitHub

If you need to update environment variables later:

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Environment Variables"
4. Add/edit/delete variables
5. Redeploy (or it auto-redeploys)

If you update code:

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically redeploys!
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. New version is live

===========================================
